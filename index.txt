Dear %%first_name%%,

Teaching literacy is challenging work for even the best teachers. 

Our LETRS (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) professional development is a flexible, interactive course of study that helps educators understand and develop an expertise in the delivery of reading instruction.

WHO IS LETRS FOR?
Teachers, coaches, and administrators of early literacy and language skills specific to K–3 and struggling students of all grade levels.

WHAT IS LETRS?
Authored by literacy experts Dr. Louisa Moats and Dr. Carol Tolman, LETRS is a professional development solution that strengthens any curriculum and helps educators understand how students learn to read, write, and spell-and why some struggle.

WHY USE LETRS? 
Not only is it a comprehensive course of study that addresses the five key components of reading, but it also offers in-person and blended options.

See for yourself what makes LETRS a success:
